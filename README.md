Satellite data is a valuable resource for training machine learning models.
Forecasting renewable generation requires knowledge of the weather conditions,
and those weather conditions can be inferred and enriched using satellite data.

EUMETSAT provide a range of satellite data products, which are easily available
in `NAT` image format. In order to improve its accessibility for training models,
this consumer processes downloaded data into the `Zarr` format.

> [!Note]
> This repo is in early development and so will undergo rapid changes.
> Breaking changes may occur in the CLI and the API without warning.


## Installation

Install using the container image:
```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/openclimatefix/satellite-consumer
```

## Example usage

```bash
$ docker run \
    -e SATCONS_COMMAND=consume \
    -e SATCONS_SATELLITE=rss \
    -e EUMETSAT_CONSUMER_KEY=<your-key> \
    -e EUMETSAT_CONSUMER_SECRET=<your-secret> \
    -v $(pwd)/work:/work \
    ghcr.io/openclimatefix/satellite-consumer
```

For a description of all the possible configuration options, see [Documentation](#documentation).

## Documentation

The satellite consumer provides a number of commands for different logical processing of raw data.
These commands (and their options) can be seen when using the cli entrypoint:

```bash
$ satellite-consumer-cli --help
```

When running the satellite consumer using the environment entrypoint (as in the docker container),
the command is chosen via an environment variable. There are also a number of common configuration
options that are shared between all commands:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SATCONS_COMMAND` |  | The command to run (consume/archive/merge). |
| `SATCONS_SATELLITE` | | The satellite to consume data from. |
| `SATCONS_WORKDIR` | `/mnt/disks/sat` | The working directory. In the container, this is set to `/work` for easy mounting. |
| `SATCONS_HRV` | `false` | Whether to download the HRV channel. |
| `EUMETSAT_CONSUMER_KEY` |  | The EUMETSAT consumer key. |
| `EUMETSAT_CONSUMER_SECRET` |  | The EUMETSAT consumer secret. |

Each command then has its own set of configuration options:

**Consume:**

*Downloads a single scan for a given time into it's own store in the working directory.*

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SATCONS_TIME` | | The time to consume data for (when using the `consume` command). Leave unset to download latest available. | 
| `SATCONS_VALIDATE` | `false` | Whether to validate the downloaded data. |
| `SATCONS_RESCALE` | `false` | Whether to rescale the downloaded data to the unit interval. |

**Archive:**

*Downloads all scans for a given month into a single store in the working directory.*

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SATCONS_MONTH` | | The month to consume data for (when using the `archive` command). |
| `SATCONS_VALIDATE` | `false` | Whether to validate the downloaded data. |
| `SATCONS_RESCALE` | `false` | Whether to rescale the downloaded data to the unit interval. |
| `SATCONS_NUM_WORKERS` | `1` | The number of workers to use for processing. |

**Merge:**

*Merges consumed stores for a given time window into a single store in the working directory.*

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SATCONS_SATELLITE` | | The satellite to consume data from. |
| `SATCONS_WINDOW_MINS` | `210` | The time window to merge data for. |
| `SATCONS_CONSUME_MISSING` | `false` | Whether to consume missing data. |

## FAQ

### How do I add a new satellite to the consumer?

Current;y the consumer is built to the specific data requirements of Open Climate Fix.
However, adding a new satellite in the from EUMETSAT shouldn't be too hard, provided it uses
the same `seviri_l1b_native` format and sensor channels - just update the available satellites
in `config.py`.

## Development

### Running the CLI

The python package contains a CLI entrypoint for ease of use when developing, which is available
to your shell via the `sat-consumer-cli` command, assuming you have built the project in a virtual
environment, and activated it.

### Linting and static type checking
 
This project uses [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static type checking
and [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting.
Installing the development dependencies makes them available in your virtual environment.

Use them via:

```bash
$ python -m mypy .
$ python -m ruff check .
```

Be sure to do this periodically while developing to catch any errors early
and prevent headaches with the CI pipeline. It may seem like a hassle at first,
but it prevents accidental creation of a whole suite of bugs.

### Running the test suite

There are some additional dependencies to be installed for running the tests,
be sure to pass `--extra=dev` to the `pip install -e .` command when creating your virtualenv.
(Or use uv and let it do it for you!)

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -s src/nwp_consumer -p "test_*.py"
```
